# Iteration 3

## 3.2 Iteration 3: Addressing Quality Attribute Scenario Driver (QA-2)

## 3.2.1 Step 2: Establish Iteration Goal by Selecting Drivers

For this iteration the architect will focus on QA-2 quality attribute scenario: A courseâ€™s information requires an update during peak registration times. Once the necessary changes are made, the system should be able to update quickly and efficiently, within 5 seconds for all users.

## 3.2.2 Step 3: Choose One or More Elements of the System to Refine

For this performance scenario, the elements that will be refined are:
- Database server
- Application server

## 3.2.3  Step 4: Choose One or More Design Concepts That Satisfy the Selected Drivers
The Design concepts used in this iteration are as follows:

| Design Decisions and Location | Rationale and Assumptions |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Implement a patch manager to effectively manage the patch update process. | Implementing a patch manager will allow for the automation of updates and much easier management of implemented patches. This will drastically speed up the update process. |
| Introduce an element from the message queue technology family. | Patches received from the patch manager will be placed in a message queue before they are retrieved by the database. The use of a queue will keep server updates in order and processing at a steady pace. |

## 3.2.4 Step 5: Instantiate Architectural Elements, Allocate Responsibilities, and Define Interfaces

The instantiation design decisions are summarized in the following table:

| Design Decisions and Location | Rationale |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- |

## 3.2.5 Step 6: Sketch Views and Record Design Decisions

## 3.2.6 Step 7: Perform Analysis of Current Design and Review Iteration
